//Item 3: Write and test a function named MultiplyTwoArraysIntoThird that sets each element in an array to the product of the corresponding elements in 
//two other arrays. For example, if array 1 has the values { 2, 4, 5, 8 } and array 2 has the values { 1, 0, 4, 6 }, the function should assign array 3 the 
//values { 2, 0, 20, 48 } . The arrays should be sent as function parameters. Be sure to include all the tests you performed to demonstrate that this 
//function works as specified.

//Header file for function library

void MultiplyTwoArraysIntoThird(double*[], double*[], double []);
